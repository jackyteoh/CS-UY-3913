// 01.31.2019 Java Lecture Notes Class 1

// Everything in Java exists inside of an object (even main)
// Syntax very similar to C++

// Only one public class per file.
// This file must be named Demo1 if you want to run it. Because the public class is called Demo1

public class Demo1{ // Java requires you to name the file the same as the public class inside the file. 
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
